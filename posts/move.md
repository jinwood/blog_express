After a 2 year stint at the Richmond Group and slightly longer in Bournemouth itself, I decided a few of weeks ago it was time for a change. I started looking on job boards and Linkedin and soon realized there weren't many places in Bournemouth I wanted to work... I began looking further afield, specifically London and realized it was probably time for me to move home and relocate somewhere with a bit more going on.

Fast forward 4 weeks, I've had a job offer and am in the process of relocating to Bristol! Exciting times! I accepted a job with a company called REPL Group who run some social media software called Gloodoo. I will be working on the Gloodoo backend.

My time at RG was extremely valuable, and I will look back and consider it the most important 2 years of my career. We had some very intense periods where prompt delivery was paramount to my survival there. I've learnt some valuable lessons and grown immeasurably as a developer. But with all things, they must come to an end. I came to a tipping point where I realized it was time for me to move on, everything moved quickly after that...

I start at Gloodoo on the 15th of May, excited, and perhaps a little anxious as to what the new job and new city might bring...
